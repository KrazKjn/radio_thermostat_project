Great! Since you're developing a **React Native app** on **Windows**, there are a few key adjustments you'll need to make:

### **Setup for React Native on Windows**
1. **Install Node.js & npm**  
   - Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and install it.
   - Verify installation:
     ```sh
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

2. **Install Chocolatey (for dependencies)**  
   - Open PowerShell **as Admin** and run:
     ```sh
     Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
     ```
     ```sh
     [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072
     ```
     ```sh
     Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1 | Invoke-Expression
     ```
   - Then install dependencies:
     ```sh
     choco install -y python2 jdk8 nodejs-lts
     ```

3. **Install React Native CLI or Expo CLI**
   - **Expo (simpler setup)**:
     ```sh
     npm install -g expo-cli
     ```
   - **React Native CLI (more control)**:
     ```sh
     npm install -g react-native-cli
     ```

4. **Create a React Native Project**
   - **Expo**:
     ```sh
     expo init MyApp
     ```
   - **React Native CLI**:
     ```sh
     npx react-native init MyApp
     ```

5. **Open in Visual Studio Code**
   - Navigate to project folder:
     ```sh
     cd MyApp
     ```
   - Open VS Code:
     ```sh
     code .
     ```

6. **Set Up Android Emulator (for Testing)**
   - Download and install **Android Studio**.
   - In **Android Studio**, install the **Android SDK & Emulator**.
   - Set up a **virtual device** (AVD) for testing.

7. **Run Your App**
   - If using **Expo**:
     ```sh
     expo start
     ```
     (Use Expo Go app for testing on a real device)
   - If using **React Native CLI**:
     ```sh
     npx react-native run-android
     ```
     (Ensure your Android emulator is running!)

Now youâ€™re ready to start building! ðŸš€ Would you like guidance on debugging or setting up additional tools like Redux or React Navigation?
